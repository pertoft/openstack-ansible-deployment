This guide shows how to get autocompletion in openstack on Ubuntu 16.04

1. Run this command to generate openstack bash completion:

openstack complete | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/osc.bash_completion > /dev/null


2. Uncomment block in /etc/bash.bashrc:
...
...

# enable bash completion in interactive shells
if ! shopt -oq posix; then
  if [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
  elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
  fi
fi

...
...


3. Logout or run bash

You can now autocomplete openstack user (tab, tab)
